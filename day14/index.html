    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 10;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lola';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = "David";

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = "Iggy";

    const team4 = [...players]; 

    team4[0] = "Lou"

    console.log(team, team2, team3, team4);

    team5 = Array.from(players);
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const dog = {
        name: 'Foofoo',
        age: 12,
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    const doggo = dog;
    dog.name = 'Winston';

    console.log(dog.name, doggo.name)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const puppy = Object.assign({}, dog, {name: 'Paris'});

    console.log(dog.name, doggo.name, puppy.name);

    //const wolf = {...dog};

    console.log(wolf.name);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
